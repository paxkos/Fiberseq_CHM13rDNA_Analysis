# Fiberseq_CHM13rDNA_Analysis
This script walks through the analysis performed on CHM13 fiber-seq analysis to obtain 6ma DNA marks for the 45S rDNA. The reference is two NCBI rDNA KY962518.fa repeats stitched together, nicknamed a "double reference". The m54329U_210418_025202.subreads.bam file was generated by Andrew Stergachis lab and obtained from their publication titled "Single-molecule architecture and heterogeneity of human telomeric DNA and chromatin", with the SRA number SRR16356599. The script uses fibertools, a CLI tool for creating and interacting with Fiber-seq BAM files developed by Mitchell Vollger.

An environment with the fibertools software must be created and activated prior to using any of the ft commands.
